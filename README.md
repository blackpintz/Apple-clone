# Appl Clone Page
This is a clone of the Apple Page.

# Short description
This is a clone of the apple website (https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/). I created it using flex, css grid and 
float css values. 
The project is a Microverse challenge to improve and test my skills building backgrounds with images and gradients.
